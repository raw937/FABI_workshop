ls -a                         # lists all files, including hidden files
ln -s <filename> <link>       # creates symbolic link to file

cat > <filename>              # places standard input into file
more <filename>               # shows the first part of a file (move with space and type q to quit)
head <filename>               # outputs the first 10 lines of file

chmod -options <filename>     # lets you change the read, write, and execute permissions on your files
gzip <filename>               # compresses files
gunzip <filename>             # uncompresses files compressed by gzip
gzcat <filename>              # lets you look at gzipped file without actually having to gunzip it
lpr <filename>                # print the file
lpq                           # check out the printer queue
